### Credit

We should acknowledge that this supplementary tutorial is heavily influenced by
the open code from published papers in Prof. Shinichi Nakagawa's lab ([see full publication list](http://www.i-deel.org/publications.html)) and from  (Associate) Prof. Wolfgang Viechtbauer's versatile `R` package `metafor` (see the [documentation](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/)). 

### Updates

This is an easy-to-implement tutorial, where you just need to have a slight modification to fit your own meta-analytic data. But we note that some arguments or script may be out of date because some packages are updating or changing in future. We will periodically update this tutorial to keep it working. The latest version of the tutorial can be found the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Yefeng0920/advanced_animal_MA_tutorial) and the Zenodo repository (https://zenodo.org/record/6622330#.YqAyH3ZBw2w)
